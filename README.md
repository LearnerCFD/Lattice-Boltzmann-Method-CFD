# Lattice-Boltzmann-Method-CFD

LBM_main.py is the original code I made for the lattice Boltzmann method simulation. I then made it into a fortran code (lbm.f90) which exports the values used to a text file. fortran_anim.py loads these values and creates an animation similar to the way the original python code does.
